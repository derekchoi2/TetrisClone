# TetrisClone
Completed in 3 days, this is a tetris clone created using MonoGame(C#) to practice my game programming. I decided to do Tetris because it is a favourite of mine, and I didn't have a game idea to work on. It only makes use of one square texture I created in Inkscape to create the tetriminos.

Features
- Random Bag implementation for fair distribution of tetriminos
- Speed increases as lines get cleared
- Ability to Hold tetrimino for future use
- Next and held tetrimino is displayed

Controls
- Left/Right arrow keys to move left/right, hold for faster movement
- Up arrow key to rotate 90 degrees clockwise
- Down arrow key to Soft Drop
- Space to Hard Drop
- "c" to hold a tetrimino
